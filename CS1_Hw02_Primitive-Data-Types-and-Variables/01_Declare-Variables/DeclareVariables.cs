 * Problem 1. Declare Variables

 * Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of
 * the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent
 * the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
 * Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.
